This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.
All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.
We used the dataset that contains data about hotel bookings

We cleaned and preprocessed the data and then we performed the exploratory data analysis to extract information from the data to answer the following questions.

How Many Booking Were Cancelled?
What is the booking ratio between Resort Hotel and City Hotel?
What is the percentage of booking for each year?
Which is the busiest month for hotels?
From which country most guests come?
How Long People Stay in the hotel?
Which was the most booked accommodation type (Single, Couple, Family)?
We learned that

Almost 35% of bookings were canceled.
More than 60% of the population booked the City hotel.
More than double bookings were made in 2016, compared to the previous year. But the bookings decreased by almost 15% next year.
Most bookings were made from July to August. And the least bookings were made at the start and end of the year.
Portugal, the UK, and France, Spain and Germany are the top countries from most guests come, more than 80% come from these 5 countries.
Most people stay for one, two, or three.
-> For Resort hotel, the most popular stay duration is three, two, one, and four days respectively.
-> For City hotel, most popular stay duration is one, two, seven(week), and three respectively
Couple (or 2 adults) is the most popular accommodation type. So hotels can make arrangement plans accordingly
We then performed feature selection and feature engineering, and then made the predictive model using the Decision Tree to predict whether our customer/guest will cancel the booking or not. And we achieved 99% accuracy.
